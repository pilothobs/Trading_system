Market Data Integration & API Fixes – 2025-02-21
Summary of Work Completed:
Fixed market data retrieval from Flask API to Ubuntu.
Confirmed trade execution from mt5_script.py is working.
Resolved API connectivity issues (SSL, headers, firewall rules).
Verified market data logging and confirmed successful data flow.
Prepared next steps for data storage and agent processing.
Key Configuration Details:
Flask API (Running on Windows VPS):

Server Address: megatradingsystem.ddns.net
Port: 5000
SSL Enabled: Yes (C:/Certs/fullchain.pem, C:/Certs/privkey.pem)
API Key Header: X-API-Key
Allowed Requests:
/market_data → Fetch live market data
/trade → Execute trades
/close_all_positions → Close open trades
/get_stored_market_data → Retrieve stored market data (coming soon)
Ubuntu Market Data Agent:

Flask API Endpoint Used: https://megatradingsystem.ddns.net:5000/market_data
Authentication Header: X-API-Key: <your-api-key>
Security Exception for SSL: --insecure flag needed in curl due to self-signed cert.
Firewall & Network Fixes:

Port 5000 Opened in Windows Firewall for Ubuntu Requests
Allowed Ubuntu IP (93.127.132.119) in Firewall Rules
Confirmed Flask is Listening on 0.0.0.0:5000 (Not Just 127.0.0.1)
Supabase Integration:
Supabase URL: https://oposkfcoyitvxeiaisal.supabase.co
Supabase API Key: <your-api-key>
Purpose: Store market data retrieved from Flask API in Supabase for further processing and retrieval by other agents.
Python Supabase Client: Used supabase-py library to connect and store data in the market_data table.
Next Steps:
Set up PostgreSQL (or decide on Redis) for market data storage.
Modify market_data_agent.py to store and serve data to other agents.
Ensure /get_stored_market_data API endpoint works for agent queries.
