Objective:
Fetch and process live market data from the Flask API using the MarketDataAgent class.
Steps Taken:
Setting Up the MarketDataAgent Class:

API Setup: Ensured that the API URL and key are loaded from the .env file.
SSL Handling: Configured the script to bypass SSL verification for self-signed certificates.
Data Fetching: Implemented a method to fetch market data from the Flask API and store it in a DataFrame.
Error Handling:

API Key Issue: Resolved by ensuring the API key is read from the .env file or passed explicitly.
SSL Certificate Issue: By using verify=False to bypass the SSL certificate verification during the request.
Data Validation: Ensured that response data is parsed correctly into a pandas DataFrame.
Testing:

Ran unit tests to mock API responses and verify that the MarketDataAgent class is functioning as expected.
Successful Execution:

The script fetched live market data and printed the first few rows of the data as a pandas DataFrame.
Issues Encountered:
SSL Certificate Verification Error: Solved by bypassing SSL checks.
API Key Missing: Ensured the API key is passed or fetched from the environment.
Solutions Implemented:
Added proper handling for environment variables using the dotenv library.
Set verify=False in the API request to handle self-signed certificates.
Validated and processed the response from the API to ensure it's in the correct format.
Results:
Successfully fetched live market data and displayed it in a pandas DataFrame.
Next Steps:
Data Storage: Consider storing the fetched data in a database for future use.
Integration: Expand functionality to integrate this data with other parts of the trading system, like executing trades.
Notes:
After days of work, the market data fetching script is now fully functional.
Saved all relevant progress for future reference, so there's no need to repeat steps.
