🚀 OrbiWealth Project Overview

System Setup

Cursor is running locally and can execute Python scripts.

Agents VPS is used for AI processing (with GPU) but does not have Flask (DO NOT SUGGEST IT).

MT5 VPS is used for trade execution and running MetaTrader 5.

No mounted drives are in use anymore; everything runs directly on each server.

📌 Current Development Tasks

✅ Completed Tasks:

[✅] Fix SSH + Cursor Setup

[✅] Set Up SSH Key Authentication (No more password prompts)

[✅] Remove Cursor VPS and consolidate work to local Cursor + Agents VPS

🔲 In Progress:

 🔲] Debug Market Data Agent

[🔲] AI Strategy Optimization

[🔲] Test Live Trading Execution on MT5 VPS

🔜 Upcoming Tasks:



🛠️ Key System Rules & Notes

Cursor edits & runs Python locally (not on VPS).

AI training runs on the Agents VPS GPU (for optimization and model training).

Market data is fetched via [Specify method if needed].

Trade execution happens only on MT5 VPS (no direct execution on Agents VPS).

🚧 Things to Avoid (Important)

❌ No Flask on Agents VPS.

❌ Cursor should not be used for anything except local coding and Python execution.

❌ Ensure that AI strategies are backtested before execution on live accounts.

📂 Useful Commands & References

SSH into Agents VPS

ssh administrator@93.127.132.119

Activate Python Virtual Environment (If Needed)

source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
Run Python Scripts in Cursor Terminal

python script_name.py

📌 Notes for Future Development

Ensure that AI-generated strategies are validated before execution.

Implement risk management models before enabling automated trading.

Improve logging and monitoring for AI strategy results.

🚀 Everything is now structured. Add new details here as needed!
